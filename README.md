#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Software engineering is the developing, testing and maintaining of software.It provides a blueprint for working to reduce risks and delivering software within a given timeframe and budget. The focus is on:
-scalability and adaptability- ensures the software can expand  and change as needed.
- reliability and maintainability- ensures the software is stable and easy to fix when issues arise.
- efficiency and effectiveness- ensures the software is fast and does its job well.
- security- ensures the software is safe from unauthorized access and data breaches.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Birth of Software Engineering
 Brought about at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference. The conference was held to address the growing need for a more systematic approach to software development. Methodologies were delberated i.e the Waterfall model and Software Development Life Cycle concepts.
-Rise of Agile and DevOps
The Agile and DevOps methodologies were developed to address the limitations of the traditional Waterfall model. Agile(2001) emphasized  iterative development and continuous improvement. DevOps(2010) focused on collaboration between development and operations teams plus improving automation.
-AI and Cloud Computing
AI and machine learning has become crucial for software engineering. AI is used for predictive maintenance, automated testing, and code analysis. Cloud computing has enabled the development of scalable and on-demand software systems.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: This phase involves defining the project scope, goals, and deliverables.
2. Requirement Analysis: This phase involves gathering and analyzing functional and non-functional requirements to understand the problem or opportunity.
3. Design: Choose framework and architecture  for the software.
4. Implementation: coding and unit testing for the software.
5. Deployment: releasing the software to the end user.
6. Maintenance: This phase involves fixing bugs, updating the software, and ensuring it continues to meet the changing needs of the users.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
                        Waterfall                                                  Agile                    
Approach:         sequential and linear                                  iterative and incremental 
Planning:         detailed upfront                                       flexible and adaptive 
Requirements:     fixed and unchanging                                   changing and evolving 
Design:           rigid and inflexible                                   flexible and adaptable
Testing:          at the end of the project                              throughout the project
Deployment:      at the end of the project                               continuous
Maintenance:     at the end of the project                               continuous

Scenarios: Waterfall; Large, complex projects with well-defined requirements, where predictability and control are essential e.g medical and government projects.
           Agile; Small to medium-sized projects with changing requirements, where flexibility and adaptability are crucial e.g social media apps and E-commerce systems.
           
           
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: Responsible for writing code, testing, and debugging software. They are also responsible for collaborating with other team members to ensure the software meets the requirements.
-Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for ensuring the software meets the quality standards. Also for testing, debugging, and validating the software.
-Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the entire project. Also, for planning, budgeting, and ensuring the project is completed on time and within budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs:- provide avenues for code editing and auto-completion
- have debugging and testing tools
-allows for compiling and running of code
-eror detection at a specific point in the code
examples: Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA.

VCS:- allows for collaboration of developers
-roll-backs; reverting back to previous versions of code 
-branching and merging of versions
-back-up and recovery of data 
examples: Git, SVN, and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing complex databases; overcomed by using design patterns and writing clear documentation of the software.
2. Debugging and troubleshooting; use of debugging tools and test-driven development to catch issues early.
3. Meeting deadlines; use of agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks.
4. Security and data privacy; implement secure coding practices and use encryption where necessary.
5. Keeping up with rapid evolving technologies; follow technology blogs, take online courses and participate in open source projects.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: testing individual components of the software to ensure they work as expected.
Integration testing: testing how different components of the software interact with each other.
System testing: testing the entire software system to ensure it meets the requirements.
Acceptance testing: testing the software to ensure it meets the user's expectations.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is crafting effective inputs to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It is crucial in AI development as it enables developers to elicit the desired output from the model.This helps improve the response quality of AI to be more precise and coherent. It also allows for creativity with research. Finally, it encourages control of AI  output to minimise misunderstanding.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: What is Medicine 
Improved prompt: Primary focus of Medicine as an undergraduate course in university

The improved prompt is more effective as it as provided a clear description of the answers the user seeks hence saving time and effort. It also reduces the risk of receiving irrelevant information.
